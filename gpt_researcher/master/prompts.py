"Content Focus":
- The report should focus on answering the question, be well-structured, informative, in-depth, and include facts and numbers if available.
- Use markdown syntax and follow the {report_format.upper()} format.

"IMPORTANT:Content and Sections Uniqueness":
- This part of the instructions is crucial to ensure the content is unique and does not overlap with existing reports.
- Carefully review the existing headers and existing written contents provided below before writing any new subsections.
- Prevent any content that is already covered in the existing written contents.
- Do not use any of the existing headers as the new subsection headers.
- Do not repeat any information already covered in the existing written contents or closely related variations to avoid duplicates.
- If you have nested subsections, ensure they are unique and not covered in the existing written contents.
- Ensure that your content is entirely new and does not overlap with any information already covered in the previous subtopic reports.

"Existing Subtopic Reports":
- Existing subtopic reports and their section headers:

    {existing_headers}

- Existing written contents from previous subtopic reports:

    {relevant_written_contents}

"Structure and Formatting":
- As this sub-report will be part of a larger report, include only the main body divided into suitable subtopics without any 'Introduction' or 'Conclusion' section.

- You MUST include markdown hyperlinks to relevant source URLs wherever referenced in the report, for example:

    ### Section Header
    
    This is a sample text. ([url website](url))

- Use H2 for the main subtopic header (##) and H3 for subsections (###).
- Use smaller Markdown headers (e.g., H2 or H3) for content structure, avoiding the largest header (H1) as it will be used for the larger report's heading.
- Organize your content into distinct sections that complement but do not overlap with existing reports.
- When adding similar or identical subsections to your report, you should clearly indicate the differences between and the new content and the existing written content from previous subtopic reports. For example:

    ### New header (similar to existing header)

    While the previous section discussed [topic A], this section will explore [topic B]."

"Date":
Assume the current date is {datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime('%B %d, %Y')} if required.

- The focus MUST be on the main topic! You MUST Leave out any information un-related to it!
- Stricty it Must NOT have any 'Introduction', 'Conclusion', 'Summary' or 'References' section.
- You MUST include hyperlinks with markdown syntax ([url website](url)) related to the sentences wherever necessary.
- Make sure that the citations are valid and the name of the Hyperlink shall be meaningful, instead of just saying 'example.com', 'sample.com' etc.,
- You MUST mention the difference between the existing content and the new content in the report if you are adding the similar or same subsections wherever necessary.
- The report should have a minimum length of {total_words} words.

1. **Structure and Clarity:** Utilize headers for each subtopic and employ lists and text formatting (such as bold and italics) to enhance readability.
2. **Content Development:** Use the provided subtopics as headings for your report sections. Each section should thoroughly address the relevant content extracted from the documents.
3. **Detail and Accuracy:** When referencing figures or dates, ensure accuracy by specifying units, currency, and the relevant fiscal or calendar year.
4. **Analytical Depth:** Provide detailed explanations of any calculations or analytical processes you undertake.
5. **Presentation:** Organize information using bullet points where applicable to improve clarity and conciseness.
6. **Source Citation:** List all sources in each section, through use of citation numbers [1], [2], [4]. At end of output, also format each numbered source entry with the source name and page number, and include a hyperlink to the document. Example format: [1] [Source Name](link#page=number)...
7. **Bias Consideration:** If a source is marked with a bias (especially from company documents), critically evaluate its claims. Indicate potential bias by prefacing information with phrases like "According to [Source]" or "The company claims."
8. **Citation Style:** Adhere strictly to the provided citation style for consistency and clarity.
9. **Use of Tables:** In sections with dense information or clear data trends, incorporate tables with citations to simplify complex data whereever possible.
10. **Language Consistency:** Always present your report in English. For non-English source material, include original terms in brackets next to their English translations, particularly for specialized jargon or unique phrases.
11. **High Quality and Insightful Suggestions**: Come up with detailed areas of further dilligence, which are very precise and can be done with deep/dives, more access to datasets. Propose datasets to request
12. **Careful & Nuanced Use of Web Search Results**: When web search results are provided, use them in a nuanced fashion, e.g: "Based on web results......, more research/cross checking could be done"
